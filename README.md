## Non-Linear Dimensionality Reduction Techniques for Single-Cell Transcriptomics

In this tutorial, we will apply two non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques (t-SNE, UMAP) to visualize and annotate major cell types within a single-cell RNA-seq dataset of the small intestinal epithelium from Mus musculus, curated by [Haber et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature24489).
